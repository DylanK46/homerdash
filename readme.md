# Introduction

**HomerDash aims to convert your homer YAML into a Dashmachine .ini config file, saving hours of re-writing.**

[Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) is a simple static  *HOM*epage for your serv*ER*  to keep your services on hand, customisable from a simple  `.yaml`  configuration file.

[Dashmachine](https://github.com/rmountjoy92/DashMachine) is another application bookmark dashboard, with fun features and is configurable from a `.ini` file.

**HomerDash** is a **python** utility tool that allows the conversion of **Homer `.yaml` files** to  **Dashmachine `.ini` files.**

 2. Extract that `.zip` file to make it a folder;
 3. In that folder, open the file called [homerdash](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash)/[sampledata](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/tree/master/sampledata)/[homer](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/tree/master/sampledata/homer)/[**config.yml**](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/blob/master/sampledata/homer/config.yml)
 and replace in your homer YAML.
 4. Head back up to 
 [homerdash](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash)/[main](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/tree/master/main)/[**main.py**](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/blob/master/main/main.py) 
 and run that python file
 5. Your output will be at
 [homerdash](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash)/[sampledata](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/tree/master/sampledata)/[dashmachine](https://github.com/DylanK46/homerdash/tree/master/sampledata/dashmachine)/**config.ini**
